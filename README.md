## Task 1: Sorting Algorithms ([Task1.ipynb](Task1.ipynb))

This notebook explores two approaches to sorting a list of dictionaries by a specified key:

1. **Manual Bubble Sort Implementation**  
   - Implements a bubble sort algorithm to sort a list of dictionaries.
   - Does not use built-in sorting or AI tools.
   - Useful for understanding basic sorting logic and algorithm efficiency.

2. **AI-Generated Sorting (Using Built-in Functions)**  
   - Uses Pythonâ€™s `sorted()` function with a lambda for key selection.
   - Demonstrates how AI/code completion tools can generate more efficient solutions.

3. **Efficiency Comparison**  
   - Benchmarks both methods using the `time` module.
   - Analyzes performance differences between manual and built-in approaches.

## Task 2: Data Analysis with Pandas and Scikit-learn ([week4.ipynb](week4.ipynb))

This notebook focuses on basic data science and exploratory data analysis tasks:

- Loads a dataset (569 rows, 31 columns).
- Displays the first 5 rows for a quick preview.
- Explores features such as mean radius, texture, perimeter, area, and more.
- Intended as a starting point for deeper analysis or machine learning tasks.

## Task 3: Web Automation with Selenium IDE ([seleniumIDE.ipynb](seleniumIDE.ipynb))

This notebook demonstrates automated web UI testing using Selenium:

- **Test Target**: [the-internet.herokuapp.com/login](https://the-internet.herokuapp.com/login)
- **Features**:
  - Automates login attempts with valid and invalid credentials.
  - Captures screenshots for each test.
  - Asserts expected outcomes (success or error messages).
  - Uses headless Chrome for efficient test execution.
- **Use Cases**:
  - Demonstrates basics of browser automation for QA.
  - Shows how to validate login flows and error handling.
