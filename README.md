# 🧠 Week 4 Assignment: AI in Software Engineering  
## Theme: *"Building Intelligent Software Solutions"* 💻🤖
## 🎯 Objective

This assignment evaluates your understanding of AI applications in software engineering through:

- ✅ Theoretical analysis
- ✅ Practical implementation
- ✅ Ethical reflection

You will demonstrate how AI can:
- Automate coding and testing
- Improve software development efficiency
- Raise and resolve ethical concerns

## ✅ Task Overview

### 🔹 Part 1: Theoretical Analysis (30%)

**Short Answer Questions**
1. Explain how AI-driven code generation tools (e.g., GitHub Copilot) reduce development time. What are their limitations?
2. Compare supervised vs. unsupervised learning in the context of automated bug detection.
3. Why is bias mitigation critical in AI-driven UX personalization?

**Case Study Analysis**  
- Read the article: *AI in DevOps: Automating Deployment Pipelines*  
- Reflect: How does AIOps improve deployment efficiency? Give two examples.

### 🔹 Part 2: Practical Implementation (60%)

**Task 1: AI-Powered Code Completion**  
- 🛠️ Tool: GitHub Copilot / Tabnine  
- Write a Python function to sort a list of dictionaries by key.  
- Compare AI-suggested vs manual code.  
- Deliverables:
  - Code files: `sort_dicts_ai.py`, `sort_dicts_manual.py`
  - 200-word analysis in `report.pdf`

**Task 2: Automated Testing with AI**  
- 🧪 Framework: Selenium IDE + AI Plugins or Testim.io  
- Automate login test for valid/invalid credentials  
- Deliverables:
  - Test file: `login_test_case.testim`
  - Screenshot: `login_test_results.png`
  - 150-word summary in `report.pdf`

**Task 3: Predictive Analytics for Resource Allocation**  
- 📊 Dataset: [Kaggle Breast Cancer Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/breast-cancer-wisconsin-data)  
- Preprocess data (clean, label, split).

-Train a model (e.g., Random Forest) to predict issue priority (high/medium/low).

-Evaluate using accuracy and F1-score.`

### 🔹 Part 3: Ethical Reflection (10%)

**Prompt:** Your predictive model is deployed in a company.  
Discuss:
- Potential dataset biases (e.g., underrepresented teams)
- How fairness tools (e.g., IBM AI Fairness 360) can help

### 🔹 Bonus Task: Innovation Challenge (Extra 10%)

**Propose an AI tool** to solve a software engineering problem not covered in class  
Example: Automated documentation generation  
📄 Deliverable: `innovation_challenge_proposal.md`
