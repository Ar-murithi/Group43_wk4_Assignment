**AI-driven testing vs. manual testing:**

Automated testing with AI plugins or enhanced Selenium scripts significantly improves test coverage and reliability compared to manual testing. AI-enhanced tools can intelligently wait for elements to appear, adapt to minor UI changes, and identify hidden issues through anomaly detection. This reduces false negatives and increases resilience against UI modifications that would break traditional scripts. By automatically running multiple test cases—valid and invalid logins, for example—AI-driven automation covers a broader range of scenarios in less time. Additionally, features like auto-screenshot and smart assertions provide clear visual evidence and precise error localization, making debugging faster and more effective. Manual testers, in contrast, are prone to fatigue and may overlook edge cases or inconsistencies. AI-powered automation ensures consistent execution, thorough coverage, and early bug detection, ultimately leading to more robust and scalable applications. This approach not only saves time and effort but also ensures higher quality and reliability in software releases.
